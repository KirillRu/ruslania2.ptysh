In this way, you will be assured that the products you order are already waiting for you when you arrive at the store - however, note that the order is handled among other online orders and may not be available for pickup during the same day! We will send a notification upon completion of the order via email, SMS or call. Pickup orders are usually ready for pick up within 2-7 business days. We keep the pick up orders for a week from the order date, after which the order is dismantled and returned to the warehouse.</div>
